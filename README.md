# Ping Pong Pair Picker
A ping pong tournament tracker technical challenge.

## The brief

The exercise is to create a tool which randomly creates pairings for a table tennis tournament from a list of names collected from the user.

Its up to you how you implement this, with JavaScript, React, or PHP, as a web page, or as an app.

Optional advanced features might include:
ability to record scores for each player, or mark which player won from each pairing, to create the next round of the tournament playoffs
continued rounds until the final (last 2 players who have won all matches to date play each other).
